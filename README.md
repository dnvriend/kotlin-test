# kotlin-test
A small study project on the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/)

## TL;DR
If you are already using Scala, and don't have big problems with Java interop ie. calling
your Scala functions from Java, then Kotlin can be a good alternative to Scala albeit with
less features.

## sbt-kotlin
To be able to build Scala/Kotlin in SBT I use the [sbt-kotlin plugin by Perry](https://github.com/pfn/kotlin-plugin).

## Kotlin as a language
Kotlin is very easy to use when you're coming from Scala because the syntax is pretty much the same. If you are coming
from Java then the transition is a bit steeper but it shouldn't be a big problem as Kotlin behaves pretty much as you
expect when you are used to Java. Just give it a try and have fun!
